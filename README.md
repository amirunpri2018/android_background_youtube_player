# BresanBackgroundYoutubePlayer

This is a simple project I've made a few years ago using the ExoMedia and ExoPlayer libraries in order to allow the playing of youtube videos in background - something that the native Youtube library (Youtube Player API) doesn't allow by itself.

In case of any doubt, feel free to ask (opening an issue or sending me a message).
